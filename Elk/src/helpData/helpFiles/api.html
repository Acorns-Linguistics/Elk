<h1 align="center"><b>The ELK Java API</b></h1>
<p>Include the <i>ElkKeyboards</i> jar file in your classpath and code your application in accordance with
the following instructions.
</p>
<p>In order to process keyboard maps in Java applications, the first step is to establish the list of 
<i>.keylayout</i> files that are available. The <i>KeyCodeLanguages</i> class provides this function. The  
constructor is called with the URL that points to the directory containing these files. The <i>KeyCodeLanguages</i> 
constructor finds the .keylayout files and the names of the languages to which they correspond. Next, 
you determine which language you want to use. The <i>getKeyboardURL</i> method asks the user for a selection 
and returns the URL to the appropriate .keylayout file. Having identified the .keylayout file, create 
a <i>KeyboardHandler</i> object that will be able to properly listen to and process user keystrokes. Finally, 
hook this handler to the JVM. The following code snippet illustrates this process.
</p>

<blockquote>
       // default path to .keylayout file folder (true would be for .ttf files)<br>
       URL  url = null;<br>
       try { url = Status.getDefaultPath(false).toURI().toURL(); }<br>
       catch (Exception e) {}<br><br>

	   // Find all the .keylayout files and associated languages<br>
       KeyLayoutLanguages dialog = new KeyLayoutLanguages(url); <br><br>

	   // If .keylayout files exist, select one of the .keylayout entries<br>
       if (dialog.isKeyLayouts()) url = dialog.getKeyboardURL(this, icon);<br>
	   
   	   // If no .keylayout files selected, exit program or add custom code<br>
       if (url==null) { System.exit(0); }<br><br>

	   // Import the keyboard map and create a handler to process it<br>
       KeyboardHandler handler = new KeyboardHandler(url);<br><br>
	   
	   // Hook a KeyEventDispatcher to process the keyboard handler in the JVM<br>
       handler.setJavaHook();<br><br>
</blockquote>
<p>The above snippet applies the keyboard map to all <i>JTextComponent</i> objects throughout the Java
application. There is another alternative which is more selective. You might want to hook the keyboard 
to specific application components. This can be done. Delete the last statement in the above snippet 
and add the following whenever you want to connect a component to a keyboard map.</p>

<blockquote>
		// Get available languages<br>
		String[] languages = dialog.getLanguages();<br><br>
		
		// Connect a component to the first language (Change index for the others)<br>
		// Note: If you have a handler object from a previous call, specify it in the third argument<br>
		KeyboardHandler handler = dialog.hookComponent(component, languages[0], null);<br>
</blockquote>

<p>To unhook the keymap from the JVM use the instruction:
<blockquote>
handler.releaseKeyboardHook();
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>To unhook the keymap from a single component, use the instruction:
<blockquote>
dialog.unhookComponent(component, handler);
</blockquote>

Note: The unhook calls correspond to the method you use to hook. If you hook the handler to the JVM, use the first unhook procedure. On
the other hand, if you hook handlers to specific components, use the second unhook approach.
