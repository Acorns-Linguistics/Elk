<p>This project is an  extension of ACORNS ([A][C]quisition [O]f [R]estored [N]ative [S]peech) which is designed to support
tribal efforts to revitalize language and culture. The acronyms are in honor of the tribes of Northern California who helped
to spawn this effort. Among these tribes the ACORN is sacred, and elks are plentiful.</a>

<p>The ACORNS project is a long-term development effort involving both graduate and undergraduate students. ACORNS and ELK
software is free for download. (ELK software is also open-source.) By downloading and using the applications, you agree to not
sell, or reverse engineer the software for profit. Please contact the author, Dan Harvey ( 
<a href="mailto:harveyd@sou.edu">harveyd@sou.edu</a>) if you have questions or comments. We welcome suggestions
and developer contributions to the ELK project.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>There are two applications associated with the ELK project. The first, called <i>ELK</i> is used to create keyboard mappings
using the popular XML-based format, .keylayout, that is the standard on MAC systems. This application can also create <i>.ttf</i> 
files remapping glyphs to reflect altered keyboard mappings. These <i>.ttf</i> files are a universal format for fonts. The ELK 
application is written in Java and therefore runs on all platforms.</p>

<p>The second ELK application, <i>ELKKeyboards</i> is a windows-based application that makes use of keyboard mappings created by ELK.
