# Elk [E]xtended [L]inquistic [K]eyboards

Elk is used to create indigenous TTF fonts to accommodate indigenous keyboard layouts. ELK also can be used to create keyboard mappings by using the MAC standard XML-based keylayout format. A second ELK application ELKKeyboards, is a windows-based application that makes use of the keyboard mappings created by ELK.
